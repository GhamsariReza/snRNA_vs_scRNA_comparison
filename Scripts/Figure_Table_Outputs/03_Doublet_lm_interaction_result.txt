# Interpretation:
# Total number of cells (total_cell) is a significant predictor of doublet_percentage, meaning that as the total number of cells increases, the percentage of doublets also tends to increase. This effect is consistent across both platforms.
# Platform (Sc vs Sn) also has an effect on doublet_percentage, with the Sn platform showing a slightly higher percentage of doublets compared to the Sc platform. However, this difference is marginally significant (p-value = 0.08279), so you may want to be cautious about drawing strong conclusions without further data.
# The interaction term between total_cell and PlatformSn is not significant, indicating that the effect of total_cell on doublet_percentage does not vary significantly between the Sc and Sn platforms. This suggests that the effect of total_cell on doublet_percentage is similar across both platforms.
# Conclusion:
# Platform: The Sn platform has a slightly higher doublet percentage than the Sc platform, but the difference is weakly significant.
# Total cell count: The total number of cells is a statistically significant predictor of doublet_percentage.
# Interaction: There is no significant interaction between total_cell and Platform, meaning the effect of total_cell on doublet percentage is similar across both platforms.
